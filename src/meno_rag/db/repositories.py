    Deletes every conversation the subject owns (via delete_subject_conversations) and the
    subject row itself — the account for a registered user (their JWT then resolves to no
    user) or the guest_session for a guest. Consent events survive; see the note below.

    Both branches also sweep records tagged with the subject's own id that the per-
    conversation cascade above would not reach — most commonly feedback, a survey answer,
    or an arena vote left on a conversation the subject does not own (an untagged/legacy
    one, which the write-side ownership policy in api/feedback.py and api/arena.py still
    lets anyone touch; see conversation_owner_matches). ArenaVote, MessageFeedback,
    SessionSurvey, and PipelineRun all carry both a user_id column and a guest_session_id
    column, so the two branches reach equally far: for a user we sweep all four by user_id;
    for a guest, by guest_session_id. Aggregate Elo (arena_ratings) is anonymous and stays
    regardless.

    The PipelineRun sweep is the one of the four that is not merely a belt-and-suspenders
    duplicate of the cascade above: the arena branch of _persist_success and
    _persist_failure can both write a pipeline_runs row (question text, under the
    improvement consent) without ever creating its conversation, so delete_subject_conversations
    never sees that session_id at all — this is the only path that ever reaches such a row.
    For a normal, conversation-linked run the delete here is redundant with the cascade
    (harmless: the row is simply already gone). Deleting a pipeline_runs row cascades to its
    pipeline_stage_runs / sources / generation_records via their run_id FK, same as through
    the cascade. A pre-migration orphan (written before these columns existed) has NULL
    owner columns and is unattributable — this sweep cannot and should not reach it; only
    the retention age-out (no matching conversation + old) eventually removes it.

    ``consent_events`` are deliberately KEPT. Art. 9 of 152-ФЗ puts the burden of proving
    that consent was obtained on the operator, so the evidentiary record has to outlive the
    account it belonged to. A consent event carries no email and no dialogue content — only
    the purpose, the decision, the document kind/version/SHA-256, the source and the
    timestamp, keyed by an id that resolves to nobody once the subject row above is gone.
    Their retention period is the operator's to set (see the legal package), not this call's.

    A retry, a double-fired client effect, or two tabs replaying the same comparison must not
    create a second (user, assistant) pair — that would reintroduce the duplicated-question,
    broken-alternation bug this feature exists to fix. When `turn_index` is not None and a
    stored `turn_kind="arena"` row already carries that `turn_index` for this conversation, it
    is updated in place instead of appending a second pair (mirrors upsert_message_feedback's
    insert-or-update shape). The existing user row is left untouched — a repost of the same
    turn carries the same question, and the invariant this closes is "no duplicate rows", not
    "keep the question text in sync".

    `turn_index=None` never matches an existing turn and always appends a fresh pair. Matching
    None against another None would make every turn_index-less post collide with every other
    one on the conversation — worse than the duplicate this guards against for the clients
    that never send it.

    If an ArenaVote for (conversation_id, turn_index) already exists — a vote that raced ahead
    of its own turn — its winner is carried onto the stored turn here: the same value
    set_arena_turn_winner would have written had the turn existed first. Skipped when
    turn_index is None for the same collision reason as above (and because
    set_arena_turn_winner/submit_arena_vote's own dedupe already treat a missing turn_index as
    unmatchable).

    `content` on the assistant row is side A's answer: the column is NOT NULL and previews and
    exports need text, while `winner` may be "tie" or "both_bad", so "the winning answer" is not
    always defined. Clients render from `arena["sides"]`.
