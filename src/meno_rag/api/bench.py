"""Recognition of the developer benchmark token.

nginx already 404s the benchmark path without a valid token, so by the time a
request reaches here the edge has checked it. This module checks it a second
time on purpose: nginx decides *reachability*, the application needs the flag to
decide *behavior* — return the full pipeline trace, write nothing to production
tables, and draw from a separate concurrency budget. It also means an SSH tunnel
straight to 127.0.0.1:9006 gets bench mode with no nginx in the path.
