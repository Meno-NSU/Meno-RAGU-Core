"""Local SQLite backups: consistent VACUUM INTO snapshots with GFS-lite rotation.

All snapshots live on the same mounted volume as the live DB (the deployment
has no off-box target yet). This protects against logical corruption, a bad
migration, accidental drops, and app bugs — NOT against loss of the volume
itself, which is a documented, deferred risk.
