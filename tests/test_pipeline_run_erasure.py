# tests/test_pipeline_run_erasure.py
"""Closes a 152-ФЗ right-to-erasure gap: pipeline_runs (and its generation_records child)
carries the user's question — and the raw answer plus retrieved KB chunks, via
generation_records — but historically had no owner column. It was only reachable through
delete_conversation_cascade, keyed on session_id matching a conversations row. Two write
paths (the arena-flagged branch of _persist_success, and _persist_failure) can create a
pipeline_runs row without ever creating that conversation, orphaning it permanently: neither
delete_subject_data (erasure) nor delete_conversations_older_than (retention) could ever
reach it.

The fix mirrors 0016_guest_owner_surveys_votes / 0014_feedback_guest_owner: an owner column
pair (user_id, guest_session_id) on pipeline_runs, populated at write time, swept on erasure,
and aged out on retention for rows no subject ever claims (including pre-migration orphans,
whose owner columns are unattributable NULL).
